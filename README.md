# Smart-Switch-Keyboard
A collaborative project to create an android Studio template and series of android keyboards for minority languages

The aims of this project are threefold:

First, to make a template for future language design which can be used by linguists with little exposure to coding to develop keyboards either for fun or to meet community needs

Second, to approach keyboard design in a manner which better takes advantage of the design space of soft keyboards and intelligently switches between layouts and inteprets inputs as you type to facilitate faster typing and less hunting for specific keys (especially in South- and South-East Asian scripts

Third, to develop support for minority languages which histoprically have been cobbled onto the back of majority language layouts, often with missing keys, and many extraneous keys which take up space and slow typing.
